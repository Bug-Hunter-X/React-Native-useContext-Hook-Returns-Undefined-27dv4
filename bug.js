This error occurs when using the `useContext` hook in React Native with a context provider that has not been properly set up or is not accessible within the component's rendering hierarchy.  The context value is therefore `undefined` leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is different from typical type errors, as it might not show up as a clear type error but rather lead to runtime issues or silent failures. 

```javascript
// Incorrect Context Setup
const MyContext = createContext();

function MyComponent() {
  const myValue = useContext(MyContext);
  // myValue will be undefined causing errors
  return <Text>{myValue}</Text>;
}
```
